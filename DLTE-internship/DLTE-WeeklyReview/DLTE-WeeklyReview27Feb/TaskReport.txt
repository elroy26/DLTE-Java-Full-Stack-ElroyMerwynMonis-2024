capture the employee permanent address and temp address ,name spliteed form,
house name,street,city,stae,pincode
eamil,phone number

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for what type of bussiness
	== do you want the user to enter the address in the splitted form 
		if yes: how many forms
			like city state country
		do you want this format for temporary address also
	   if the user enters the address how would admin like to view it. like do you want counts of type
		
	== along with adress what other details you want to retrive from the customer

	== so along with address do you want the name of the person who is entering the address
		if yes:
			do you want user to enter the name in one line or
			multiple line(first name,middle name, last name)
		how do you want to view the name should itbe associate with the city

tostring():	
use loop
how will we know in how many placess we havae use mthods	
Debug mode- reach upto a specific point and reach onto it	
see documentation
try with foreach
what is null pointerexception

check null for the required vlues
then use if condition for handling the exception
performance faster. fintuning the code

missed requremnt gathering started striaght away class
have design on a document before starting
segregate the code- be conceptually clear, performance handling, do more hands on, 
use debugger- at the run time change the value of the data get familiar.
	step by step, go specific point


next time add switch input and display error handling, 
	so while readig if the user wants to enter then continue it or else show the menu

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
is it possible to have have break in method
after break there iscode will the code execute
what is the use of return
if i give invalid input in swith case why will it ask again
while designing make it more user frendly

can i make a 2 differnt pom.xml like one for input and other for output

implement trycatch, one to many,loggers,properties 
cqn we keep files in the network , how to access it

display for a specific pincode filter method
can we retrive the specific content from the file

------------
is it required to keep the properties in the resource directory where are we reading it,
what does getbundle give . what does it do
what is the difference between the txt and properties file
why should we use properties
place it in differnet location and check it
how to know if i am using the method in differnt project struture
will printstack trace will it print in log file
for run time exception waht type of logger level should we use
use user defined exception


----------------------------

dont create object for validation everytime because it consumes space
keep validation in the util class so others can access
garbage collector
crate acommon place for the notes
see atleast one test data 
in file while stroing data store it in the readabe form
how arraylist is stored in the file 
string Tokenizer store it in the form of stong with deliiters
while stroring we will strore it has a string
but while retiving we will retrive it from the a byte method 
read the file line by line from the program 
design architecture 
slf4j: should we use logback name only other name is allowed
can we write it in the same file all the time if the file is 1gb of size then can i open it in the notepad
can i make sure only error is added to the log file not the info---- check about enabling the log level 
start designing the interface

why version snapshot is used---- sir explained it 2.0.7-highEffect.majoreffect.bugFixes(lessEffect)

do 2.0 snapshot new one with database

------------------
13/03/2024
use a vaiable if only one employee list is used if many employee list are there then use lists
each backend should have interface. so middleware should not have interface all time time
object->businesslogic(valicdation)->interface->implementaion 
get should be done in the console and set in backend

-----------------------------
19/03/2024

make sure the classname is samiliar to the package name
make sure while using constructor the passing arguments are not lengthy
make sure the package nameformat is good has the external dependency
what is the differnce between the break and return and continue;

comment the qureies on the worksheet sql developers when there are multiple qureies in the worksheet
add the constraint violation exception
make sure the user know what exception is happening like the exact reason what user shold kow not the inbuld 
in which all cases sqlintegrity constraint violation excepton

in the webservice how many cases we should we consider for a particular method
for a particular signature return type homeny cases can we return if all how do we do it
for multiple exception we can use thows keyword
for the most of the error we give message has system error

---------------------------------
20/03/2024

use constor only while necessary and try to use the methods of initialize the connection
bussness logic in another package 
dont use constructor for the database connection

let the query return everting for the filter pincode and use the stream for that filterpincode method. 
try to use all the concepts learned till now in this emplyee project
join and inner joim is not same check with on and in 
so one database connection can it have multiple database
defien our own schema and make sure it has only the table that i want see not the default tables 
version mangement layer, module

console(3.0) <-> webservice(1.0) <-> backend database(1.0)

waht is the diffence between the methods in ha=java and the websevice


===================================
02/04/2024

learn http code
who is preparing the the hhtp code server or coder
handle the http errors and send message to the client
use if else for throwing exception

--------------------------------
03/04/2024

if there is server error the that getEnity what does it hold 
check the null pointer response and the response .getentity should not get null value always check it.
differntiate which role. like producer, tester, etc
what is components 
user properties got the url 
and also use the methods for th eurl
develop the spring project for the employee


=============================================
17/04/2024

jdbc and nomal java sql differnce
	the whole life cycle is controlled in noraml java but in spring container takes the control
for login add java 8 features
make sure the dao return waht the query returns
and do the filter in the webservice 
same method can be written in multiple way
insurance name must be unique
stream filter how does it acutally work
without mock data how do i test it
test all the possible cases

==================================
23/04/2024

is it possible to start the developement for the dao and the webservice at the same time or it shoud start att he differnt time
check about the customre id , insurane name and insurance type
customer id 
know the bussiness functionality of all the teams on the modules they are working on
