concurrency:
	synchonization using lock>>lock unlock-> locak and unlock,sin the joinm methods
	executor -mewchasehd
	thread pool.- cached thread pool, scheduled thread pool

Mutable: it pdates automatically,
	insert recored in the particular position
	insert(pos,charter),delte(Staert,end),apend(obj),toSting();

waht is the diffence between

	Stringbuffer-it is mutable, it access serially.	
	
	Stringbuilder-asynchronous, at the pararelle time multiple thread are access

storage logics;
	array >>linewt,staic,tempotraru,no invuilt methods
	collections >> dynamic,builtin methods,temporary memmory
	
	Database	>> permanent	>> server
	file	>>permanent	>>local system

java.io
file >>absolute Path,name, createNewFile ,
stream >>: it is a pipeline between java file to secondary memeory and it tranfer in the form of binary data.it onl accepts only in bytestream
	inputStream >> reading
		FileInputStream
		DataInputStream
		ObjectioInputStream
		InflatrerInputStream
		InflaterInputSTream: 
	
	outputstream >>writing
		Fileoutputstream
		objectoutputstream
		DeflaterOutputStream: convert into unreadable form encrypt it, it comes from java.util.zip package
reader,writer,
use \\ 
stream will decide whether to read or write , unlike in python
for appending the file add true in fileoutput stream methoda

Serializable is used to convert object to file
