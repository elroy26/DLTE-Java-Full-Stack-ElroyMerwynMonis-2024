Singleton classes: it is a class where it has one instance at time
eg: runtime.getruntime();

== multithreading:
eg: lot

parellel processing

components:
	resource class/service provider
	1. extends thread>> java.lan
	2. implements runnable>> java.Lang
if we wan to access the resource class the execution begins form the run() method
public void run(){
	Thread.currentThread().getName()
}


main class;
	customer/thread created towards the resouce
Thread obj=new Thread(resorce,"nameof the thread');

--execute:
start- it goes to the run method
run-it goes to main

singletask multithread>>svncronized thread makes sure one thread is executed at atime
multi task multithead>> inside the run method we use syncronized so thaat particaular thread is executed one at time ousise that other thread can be executed any tie.----also we can use the join method so that one thread exutes then other thread have to wait.

method references: inheritence acan be avoidance object::member
the objet has no definaition

Tread life cyle:
born
running: start run notify

passing data from one thread to the other can be done by constructor
interthread communication

SQL-------------------------
--DCL: we are creatibg a user and give privilege using dcl, 
	grant,revoke
	select,connect,inset ,deelte,create

%e%-anything with begging followed by e and ending anythig

=== to create er diagram
file->datamodula->improt->datadictionary

== Joins:
left,right,inner full
